#### Node.js

Although you **do not need `Node.js` to use this library in your application**, you'll need to install `Node.js` (and it's corresponding package manager, `npm`) for your system before contributing.

- v10

If you're having trouble getting a component of `plasma-utils` running, please try installing one of the above versions of `Node.js` and try again.
It's pretty easy to switch `Node.js` versions using `n`.
First, install `n` globally.

npm install -g n
```

Next, install your desired verson of `Node.js`, say `v10`:

```
n 10
```
