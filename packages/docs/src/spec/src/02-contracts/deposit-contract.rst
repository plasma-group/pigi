Deposit Contract
################

***********
Description
***********
Deposit contracts are the Ethereum smart contracts into which assets are deposited--custodying the money as it is transacted on plasma and playing out the exit games to resolve the rightful owners of previously deposited assets.  As such, it contains the bulk of the logic for the plasma exit games.  The things it does not cover are 1) block commitments, and 2), state deprecation, which are handled by calls to the commitment contract and predicate contracts specifically.

Structs
=======

Range
-----

.. code-block:: solidity

   struct Range {
       uint256 start;
       uint256 end;
   }

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Represents a range of `state objects`_.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``start`` - ``uint256``: Start of the range of objects.
2. ``end`` - ``uint256``: End of the range of objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


StateObject
-----------

.. code-block:: solidity

   struct StateObject {
       string id;
       address predicate;
       bytes data;
   }

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Represents a `state object`_. Contains the address of the `predicate contract`_ and input data to that contract which control the conditions under which the object may be mutated.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``id`` - ``string``: A globally unique identifier for this state object. 
2. ``predicateAddress`` - ``address``: Address of the `predicate contract`_ that dictates how the object can be mutated.
3. ``data`` - ``bytes``: Arbitrary state data for the object.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


StateUpdate
-----------

.. code-block:: solidity

   struct StateUpdate {
       Range range;
       StateObject stateObject;
       address plasmaContract;
       uint256 plasmaBlockNumber;
   }

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Represents a `state update`_, which contains the contextual information for how a particular range of `state objects`_ was mutated.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``range`` - ``Range``: Range of state objects that were mutated.
2. ``stateObject`` - ``StateObject``: Resulting state object created by the mutation of the input objects.
3. ``plasmaContract`` - ``address``: Address of the plasma contract in which the update was included.
4. ``plasmaBlockNumber`` - ``uint256``: Plasma block number in which the update occurred.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Checkpoint
----------

.. code-block:: solidity

   struct Checkpoint {
       StateUpdate stateUpdate;
       Range subRange;
   }

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Represents a `checkpoint`_ of a particular state update on which a "checkpoint game" is being or has been played out.  Checkpoints which have successfully passed the checkpoint game are considered "finalized", meaning the plasma contract should ignore all state updates on that range with an older plasma block number.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``stateUpdate`` - ``StateUpdate``: State update being checkpointed.
2. ``subRange`` - ``Range``: Sub-range of the state update being checkpointed. We include this field because the update may be `partially spent`_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CheckpointStatus
----------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   struct CheckpointStatus {
       uint256 challengeableUntil;
       uint256 outstandingChallenges;
   }

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Status of a particular checkpoint attempt.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``challengeableUntil`` - ``uint256``: Ethereum block number until which the checkpoint can still be challenged.
2. ``outstandingChallenges`` - ``uint256``: Number of outstanding challenges.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Challenge
---------

.. code-block:: solidity

   struct Challenge {
       Checkpoint challengedCheckpoint;
       Checkpoint challengingCheckpoint;
   }

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Describes a challenge against a checkpoint.  A challenge is a claim that the ``challengingCheckpoint`` has no valid transactions, meaning that the state update in the ``challengedCheckpoint`` could never have been reached and thus is invalid.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``challengedCheckpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: Checkpoint being challenged.
2. ``challengingCheckpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: Checkpoint being used to challenge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Public Variables
================

COMMITMENT_ADDRESS
------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   address constant COMMITMENT_ADDRESS;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Address of the `commitment contract`_ where block headers for the plasma chain are being published.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deposit contracts **MUST** specify the address of a `commitment contract`_ where plasma chain block headers are being published.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
Deposit contracts handle deposits and exits from a specific plasma chain. Commitment contracts hold the plasma block headers for that plasma chain and therefore make it possible to verify `inclusion proofs`_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TOKEN_ADDRESS
-------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   address constant TOKEN_ADDRESS;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Address of the `ERC-20 token`_ which this deposit contract custodies.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The deposit contract:
   - **MUST** only support deposits of a single `ERC-20 token`_.
- ``TOKEN_ADDRESS``:
   - **MUST** be the address of an ERC-20 token.

Rationale
---------
Each asset type needs to be allocated its own large contiguous "sub-range" within the larger Plasma Cashflow chain. Without these sub-ranges, `defragmentation`_ becomes effectively impossible. Although it's possible to achieve this result within a single deposit contract, it's easier to simply require that each asset have its own deposit contract and to allocate a large sub-range to every deposit contract.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CHALLENGE_PERIOD
----------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   uint256 constant CHALLENGE_PERIOD;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Number of Ethereum blocks for which a checkpoint may be challenged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EXIT_PERIOD
-----------

.. code-block:: solidity

   uint256 constant EXIT_PERIOD;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Number of Ethereum blocks before an exit can be finalized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


totalDeposited
--------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   uint256 public totalDeposited;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Total amount deposited into this contract.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


checkpoints
-----------

.. code-block:: solidity

   mapping (bytes32 => CheckpointStatus) public checkpoints;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Mapping from the `ID of a checkpoint`_ to the checkpoint's status.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


exitableRanges
--------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   mapping (uint256 => Range) public exitableRanges;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Stores the list of ranges that have not been exited as a mapping from the ``start`` of a range to the full range. Prevents multiple exits from the same range of objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


exits
-----

.. code-block:: solidity

   mapping (bytes32 => uint256) public exits;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Mapping from the `ID of an exit`_ to the Ethereum block after which the exit can be finalized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


challenges
-----------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   mapping (bytes32 => bool) public challenges;

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Mapping from the `ID of a challenge`_ to whether or not the challenge is currently active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   event CheckpointStarted(
       Checkpoint checkpoint,
       uint256 challengeableUntil
   );

2. ``challengeableUntil`` - ``uint256``: Ethereum block in which the checkpoint was started.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CheckpointChallenged
--------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   event CheckpointChallenged(

.. code-block:: solidity

   event CheckpointFinalized(
       bytes32 checkpoint
   );

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Emitted whenever a checkpoint is finalized.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``checkpoint`` - ``bytes32``: `ID of the checkpoint`_ that was finalized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ExitStarted
-----------

.. code-block:: solidity

   event ExitStarted(
       bytes32 exit,
       uint256 redeemableAfter
   );

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Emitted whenever an exit is started.

Fields
^^^^^^

2. ``redeembleAfter`` - ``uint256``: Ethereum block in which the exit will be redeemable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ExitFinalized
-------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   event ExitFinalized(
       Checkpoint exit
   );

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Emitted whenever an exit is finalized.

Fields
^^^^^^
1. ``exit`` - ``Checkpoint``: `The checkpoint`_ that had its exit finalized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Methods
=======

deposit
-------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function deposit(
       address _depositer,
       uint256 _amount,
       StateObject _initialState
   ) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Allows a user to submit a deposit to the contract. Only allows users to submit deposits for the `asset represented by this contract`_.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_depositer`` - ``address``: the account which has approved the ERC20 deposit.
2. ``_amount`` - ``uint256``: Amount of the asset to deposit. 
3. ``_initialState`` - ``StateObject``: Initial state to put the deposited assets into. Can be any valid `state object`_.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** keep track of the total deposited assets, ``totalDeposited``.
- **MUST** transfer the deposited ``amount`` from the ``depositer`` to the deposit contract's address.
- **MUST** create a `state update`_ with a `state object`_ equal to the provided ``initialState``.
- **MUST** compute the range of the created state update as ``totalDeposited`` to ``totalDeposited + amount``.
- **MUST** update the total amount deposited after the deposit is handled.
- **MUST** insert the created state update into the ``checkpoints`` mapping with ``challengeableUntil`` being the current block number - 1.
- **MUST** emit a ``CheckpointFinalized`` event for the inserted checkpoint.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
Depositing is the mechanism which locks an asset into the plasma escrow agreement, allowing it to be transacted off-chain.  The ``initialState`` defines its spending conditions, in the same way that a ``StateUpdate`` does once further transactions are made.  Because deposits are verified on-chain transactions, they can be treated as checkpoints which are unchallengeable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


startCheckpoint
---------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function startCheckpoint(
       Checkpoint _checkpoint,
       bytes _inclusionProof,
       uint256 _exitableRangeId
   ) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Starts a checkpoint for a given state update.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_checkpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: Checkpoint to be initiated.
2. ``_inclusionProof`` - ``bytes``: Proof that the state update was included in the block specified within the update.
3. ``_exitableRangeId`` - ``uint256``: The key in the ``exitableRanges`` mapping which includes the ``subRange`` as a subrange.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** verify the that ``checkpoint.stateUpdate`` was included with ``inclusionProof``.
- **MUST** verify that ``subRange`` is actually a sub-range of ``stateUpdate.range``.
- **MUST** verify that the ``subRange`` is still exitable with the ``exitableRangeId`` .
- **MUST** verify that an indentical checkpoint has not already been started.
- **MUST** add the new pending checkpoint to ``checkpoints`` with ``challengeableUntil`` equalling the current ethereum ``block.number + CHALLENGE_PERIOD`` .
- **MUST** emit a ``CheckpointStarted`` event.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
Checkpoints are assertions that a certain state update occured/was included, and that it has no intersecting unspent state updates in its history.  Because the operator may publish an invalid block, it must undergo a challenge period in which the parties who care about the unspent state update in the history exit it, and use it to challenge the checkpoint.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


challengeCheckpointOutdated
---------------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function challengeCheckpointOutdated(
       Checkpoint _olderCheckpoint,
       Checkpoint _newerCheckpoint
   ) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Challenges a checkpoint by showing that there exists a newer finalized checkpoint. Immediately cancels the checkpoint.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_olderCheckpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: `The checkpoint`_ to challenge.
2. ``_newerCheckpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: `The checkpoint`_ used to challenge.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** ensure the checkpoint ranges intersect.
- **MUST** ensure that the plasma blocknumber of the ``olderCheckpoint`` is less than that of ``newerCheckpoint``.
- **MUST** ensure that the ``newerCheckpoint`` has no challenges.
- **MUST** ensure that the ``newerCheckpoint`` is no longer challengeable.
- **MUST** delete the entries in ``exits`` and ``checkpoints`` at the ``[olderCheckpointId]``.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
If a checkpoint game has finalized, the safety property should be that nothing is valid in that range's previous blocks--"the history has been erased."  However, since there still might be some ``StateUpdates`` included in the blocks prior, invalid checkpoints can be initiated.  This method allows the rightful owner to demonstrate that the initiated ``olderCheckpoint`` is invalid and must be deleted.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


challengeCheckpointInvalidHistory
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function challengeCheckpointInvalid(
       Challenge _challenge
   ) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Starts a challenge for a checkpoint by pointing to an exit that occurred in an earlier plasma block. Does **not** immediately cancel the checkpoint. Challenge can be blocked if the exit is cancelled.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_challenge`` - ``Challenge``: Challenge to submit.


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** ensure that the checkpoint being used to challenge exists.
- **MUST** ensure that the challenge ranges intersect.
- **MUST** ensure that the checkpoint being used to challenge has an older ``plasmaBlockNumber``.
- **MUST** ensure that an identical challenge is not already underway.
- **MUST** ensure that the current ethereum block is not greater than the ``challengeableUntil`` block for the checkpoint being challenged.
- **MUST** increment the ``outstandingChallenges`` for the challenged checkpoint.
- **MUST** set the ``challenges`` mapping for the ``challengeId`` to true.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
If the operator includes an invalid ``StateUpdate`` (i.e. there is not a deprecation for the last valid ``StateUpdate`` on an intersecting range), they may checkpoint it and attempt a malicious exit.  To prevent this, the valid owner must checkpoint their unspent state, exit it, and create a challenge on the invalid checkpoint.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



removeChallengeCheckpointInvalidHistory
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function removeChallengeCheckpointInvalidHistory(
       Challenge _challenge
   ) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Decrements the number of outstanding challenges on a checkpoint by showing that one of its challenges has been blocked.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_challenge`` - ``Challenge``: `The challenge`_ that was blocked.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** check that the challenge was not already removed.
- **MUST** check that the challenging exit has since been removed.
- **MUST** remove the challenge if above conditions are met.
- **MUST** decrement the challenged checkpoint's ``outstandingChallenges`` if the above conditions are met.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
Anyone can exit a prior state which was since spent and use it to challenge despite it being deprecated.  To remove this invalid challenge, the challenged checkpointer may demonstrate the exit is deprecated, deleting it, and then call this method to remove the challenge.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


startExit
---------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function startExit(Checkpoint _checkpoint) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Allows the predicate contract to start an exit from a checkpoint. Checkpoint may be pending or finalized.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_checkpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: `The checkpoint`_ from which to exit.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** ensure the checkpoint exists.
- **MUST** ensure that the ``msg.sender`` is the ``_checkpoint.stateUpdate.predicateAddress`` to authenticate the exit's initiation.
- **MUST** ensure an exit on the checkpoint is not already underway.
- **MUST** set the exit's ``redeemableAfter`` status to the current Ethereum ``block.number + LOCKUP_PERIOD``.
- **MUST** emit an ``exitStarted`` event.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
For a user to redeem state from the plasma chain onto the main chain, they must checkpoint it and respond to all challenges on the checkpoint, and await a ``LOCKUP_PERIOD`` to demonstrate that the checkpointed subrange has not been deprecated.  This is the method which starts the latter process on a given checkpoint.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


challengeExitDeprecated
-----------------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function deprecateExit(
       Checkpoint _checkpoint
   ) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Allows the predicate address to cancel an exit which is deprecated.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_checkpoint`` - ``Checkpoint``: `The checkpoint`_ referenced by the exit.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** ensure the ``msg.sender`` is the ``_checkpoint.stateUpdate.predicateAddress`` to ensure the deprecation is authenticated.
- **MUST** delete the ``exit`` from ``exits`` at the ``checkpointId`` .

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
If a transaction exists spending from a checkpoint, the checkpoint may still be valid, but an exit on it is not.  This method allows the predicate to remove the exit if it has determined it to be outdated.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


finalizeExit
------------

.. code-block:: solidity

   function finalizeExit(Checkpoint _exit, uint256 _exitableRangeId) public

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Finalizes an exit that has passed its exit period and has not been successfully challenged.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``_exit`` - ``Checkpoint``: `The checkpoint`_ on which the exit is not finalizable.
2. ``_exitableRangeId`` - ``uint256``: the entry in ``exitableRanges`` demonstrating the range is not yet exited.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **MUST** ensure that the exit finalization is authenticated from the predicate by ``msg.sender == _exit.stateUpdate.state.predicateAddress``.
- **MUST** ensure that the checkpoint is finalized (current Ethereum block exceeds ``checkpoint.challengeableUntil``).
- **MUST** ensure that the checkpoint's ``outstandingChallenges`` is 0.
- **MUST** ensure that the exit is finalized (current Ethereum block exceeds ``redeemablAfter`` ).
- **MUST** ensure that the checkpoint is on a subrange of the currently exitable ranges via ``exitableRangeId``.
- **MUST** make an ERC20 transfer of the ``end - start`` amount to the predicate address.
- **MUST** delete the exit.
- **MUST** remove the exited range by updating the ``exitableRanges`` mapping.
- **MUST** delete the checkpoint.
- **MUST** emit an ``exitFinalized`` event.

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^
Exit finalization is the step which actually allows the assets locked in plasma to be used on the main chain again.  Finalization requires that the exit and checkpoint games have completed successfully.
